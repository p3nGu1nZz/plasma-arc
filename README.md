## Installation

To get started with the Plasma Arc Project, you'll need to set up your environment by following the steps below. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed and then clone the repository to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- Python (v3.10 or higher)
- A WebGPU-compatible browser (e.g., Chrome Canary, Firefox Nightly)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p3nGu1nZz/plasma-arc.git
cd plasma-arc
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Simulation

Running the simulation is simple. Start the server, open the HTML file in your browser, and modify configurations as needed.

1. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`** in your WebGPU-compatible browser.

3. **Modify the Configurations** as needed in the `config` object.

4. **Refresh the Browser** to see your changes instantly with fast iterative development.

## Testing

Testing is an essential part of ensuring the stability and functionality of the Plasma Arc Project. We use Jest for testing our code.

### Run Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
